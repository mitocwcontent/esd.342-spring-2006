Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Learning Objectives
-------------------

### What We Will Do in This Course

*   Read the academic literature, including our own notes and papers.
*   Learn and practice some existing analytical methods, mainly network methods.
*   Appreciate the wide range of domains where theory and methods have been applied.
*   Critique existing theory and methods.
*   Share our knowledge and experience.
*   Analyze some real systems in detail.
*   Distil common concepts that emerge from theory and that apply to many kinds of systems.

### How to Learn

*   We will learn about architecture/structure by examining a wide variety of systems such as biological, sociological, economic at a variety of levels in addition to the technological and organizational systems of most direct interest to us, because
*   These systems are similar in many ways, perhaps more than we think.
*   Since we want to influence structure (not just accept it as we are interested in **design**), we will also explore how structure is determined by looking at system typologies and constraints that influence or determine the structure.
*   We will use network methods - a choice of level of abstraction.

### Important Topics at the "Research Front"

*   How useful are the metrics that exist for architectural or structural attributes in the case of Engineering Systems (high complexity and heterogeneity)?
*   Can we invent metrics for heterogeneous systems that are more useful indicators of important "properties of real systems"?
*   Can we quantify important properties such as flexibility and find analytical relationships to some structural metrics?

### More Research Front Topics

*   To what extent are intuitively important aspects of architecture quantifiable and measurable?
*   Are there useful paradigms, patterns, principles or other lessons from natural systems that researchers on real system architectures can use - and how can they be used?
*   Assuming we know what functions, performance, and abilities we want, what methods can be used to create a suitable architecture?
*   Assuming we know what architecture we want, what are the most effective ways of influencing the architecture of complex, evolving engineering systems?

Textbooks and Readings
----------------------

The required text for this course is:

Watts, Duncan. _Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age_ . New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co., 2004. ISBN: 0393325423.

Additional [readings]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings) consisting of book excerpts and papers are assigned for most class sessions.

The course also uses this downloadable book that doubles as a user guide to UCINET software: Hanneman, R. A., and M. Riddle. [_Introduction to social network methods_](http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/).

Assignments
-----------

Students complete three homework assignments during the term.

Case Study Project
------------------

Students complete a team-based case study project, with periodic reports in class leading to a final presentation and a written report.
